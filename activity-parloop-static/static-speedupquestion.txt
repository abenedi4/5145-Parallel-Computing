After running make plot on the results of my parallel for-loop static scheduling code, I believe that the speedup 
looks correct. As the number of threads increase as well as the intensity, there is a gradual increase in speedup. 
This makes sense since with each thread, the amount of work is partitioned, thus decreasing the amount of 
compile time needed. Furthermore, the speedup is also more apparent with a larger n value. This is because there 
are more iterations to complete, so the speedup will drastically improve with more threads to distribute this work. 
With smaller n values (i.e. 1-100), the speedup is not as drastic because
even with a large number of threads, there is only so much work to complete (causing a plateau effect).

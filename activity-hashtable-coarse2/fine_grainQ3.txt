After using fine-grained synchronization in the hash table data structure, 
I was able to get a much higher speedup. The speedup of my implementation of 
fine-grained synchronization varied from 3 as the max to a bit below 3, depending 
on the number of processors. Since the speedup was expected to be between 3 and 4, I was 
hoping for it to be a little bit higher, but it did reach the 3 mark as the maximum speedup. I think this
may be effected by the number of mutexes I created in my mutex array, as I originally had 
less mutexes and resulted in a lesser speedup, then added more and seemed to have a more steady
increase of speedup based on # processors.

Update:
I tested again with an even larger array of mutexes and got speedup to be
more steadily at 3 with a max of 3.5.
